                2.1. Display/Performance Settings
                
                The Graphical Settings can directly impact the memory usage of the game. If your 
                computer lacks RAM memory, these settings should be lowered down accordingly.
                
                There are some video card drivers that may cause flickering and disappearing 
                objects. It is important to make sure the latest available drivers are installed.

                When launching the game for the first time, the game will detect the highest
                supported DX setting your video card is capable of (either DX9 or DX11) and set
                this as default.  The DX setting can then be changed in the in-game menu.
                
                --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                2.3. Uplay PC
                
                This game requires a one-time online activation via Uplay PC.
                
                Create a new Uplay account in the Uplay applicaiton or at Uplay.com or use your 
                existing Uplay account and the Unique Key that came with your game to bind the
                game to your account.
                
                Launching the game after this one-time application is possible in online and
                offline mode.  Not all game functionality is available in Offline Mode.
                
                For Uplay licenses see the installation directory of the Uplay application and 
                check the data\resources\LICENSES.TXT file

                Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell® Blacklist™ requires DirectX runtime libraries from 
                June 2010 or later to run properly. To get the latest version of DirectX, please

                http://www.microsoft.com/download/
                 
                DirectX is also provided on the install disc in the folder Support\DirectX and 
                automatically installed when you install Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell® Blacklist™.
                 
                If you receive an error message about missing DLL files, reinstall DirectX from
                the install disc to correct the problem.
                
                --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                3.4. Hints
                
                * It is not advisable to install the game into the Windows folder (usually
                  C:\Windows), a subfolder of the Windows folder, nor the root of the system
                  drive (usually C:\).
                
                * It is recommended to close all other running programs before installing the
                  game, to reduce the risk of software conflicts.
                
                * If you experience graphical corruption, make sure your graphics driver's
                  control panel is not configured to override application settings.
                  
                * Vibration support is only supported if using the Xbox 360 controller.

                and get the latest replacement policy and pricing. We will not accept 
                unsolicited returns/exchanges without prior approval and an RMA 
                (Return Materials Authorization) number from a support representative.
